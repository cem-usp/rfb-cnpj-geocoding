  abstract = {terra provides methods to manipulate geographic (spatial) data in "raster" and "vector" form. Raster data divide space into rectangular grid cells and they are commonly used to represent spatially continuous phenomena, such as elevation or the weather. Satellite images also have this data structure, and in that context grid cells are often referred to as pixels. In contrast, "vector" spatial data (points, lines, polygons) are typically used to represent discrete spatial entities, such as a road, country, or bus stop.},
